today was a slow day
while my goal is constant improvement it is always a blessing to enjoy stillness
my plan for the next few days is constant work and improvement
this will be the first time that I will investy a large amount of time into a personal project
I wonder what I will learn
doing this does help with my memory
while I still need a guide to do this I don't want to rush this
coding is something I have to incorporate into my daily life
and while this journaling is cumbersome at times
it reminds me to be accountable for my progress even in one task
